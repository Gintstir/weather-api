# Weather Dashboard

This is the completed sixth weekly challenge for the UPENN LPS Coding Bootcamp.<br><br>
This project required us to build a weather dashboard using [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/).<br>
According to the grading rubric the scheduler had to meet the following requirements:<br>

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
